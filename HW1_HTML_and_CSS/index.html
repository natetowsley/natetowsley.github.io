            <h3 class="topicheading">Clients and Servers</h3>
            <p class="overview">When you use the web, your device that is connected to the internet
                is known as the "client", and must communicate with a "server" in what is 
                similar to a conversation. The client and server make 
                <a href="requests_and_responses.html" target="_blank">requests and responses</a>, using
                HTTP protocol to send the correct data to your browser, so you can browse the web as you please.
                The IP address of a website is how your browser knows where to request information from. 
                A website's IP address is similar to your address for where you live, but in a much different
                looking format. The <a href="servers.html" target="_blank">server</a> then must handle this request and 
                allow the client to download a copy of what is to be displayed.

            <p class="overview">So how do websites remember who you are? When you visit a website, you may be asked to "allow cookies"
                 While I'm a big fan of chocolate chip, this isn't what were talking about. A <a href="cookies.html">session cookie</a> is
                 a text file that keeps track of your activity on a website. These cookies are only active each time you're on that website, 
                 and are deleted when you leave your browser. These cookies often make the internet a better experience for most, showing them
                 things they want to see based on their activity.
