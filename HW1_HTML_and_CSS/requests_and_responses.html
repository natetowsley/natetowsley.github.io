        <p><span class="bigtext"><strong>So how does your device talk to the website?</strong></span> Well,
        this is done through a protocol known as HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol). This protocol is a collection of rules
        that the server uses to get information to your device correctly. When you search for a website through the browser, 
        you're really making a "request" to a web server. Methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE as well as others are used to perform various
        actions between client and server. HTTP is also "stateless". This means that each request is executed with no knowledge of any of
        the other requests or what they entailed. Websites use <a class="inlineLink" href="cookies.html">"Cookies"</a> to create a stateful session. This allows the website to
        remember who you are, and what you've done previously on the website.</p>
